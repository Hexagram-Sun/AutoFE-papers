# AutoFE papers
This is a collection of significant papers on Automated Feature Engineering (AutoFE), an essential process in machine learning (ML) that involves automatically selecting and transforming the input features to improve the performance of ML models.

## Introduction

Feature engineering is a crucial step in the development of machine learning models. It involves the creation, selection, and transformation of raw data into features that can be used in machine learning algorithms. However, manual feature engineering is time-consuming, requires domain expertise, and is often considered more of an art than a science. Automated Feature Engineering (AutoFE) aims to automate this process, making it more efficient and accessible to practitioners without deep domain knowledge.

AutoFE techniques leverage algorithms to discover feature transformations and interactions that are most relevant to the model's predictive performance. This automation helps in significantly reducing the time and effort involved in manual feature selection and transformation, thus speeding up the model development process and potentially uncovering complex patterns in the data that might not be evident through manual analysis.

The core idea behind AutoFE is not just to automate the feature engineering process but also to optimize it in a way that maximally enhances the performance of machine learning models. This involves a combination of search algorithms, statistical techniques, and machine learning methods to evaluate and select the best features.
